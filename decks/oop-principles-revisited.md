# OOP PRINCIPLES REVISITED

## WHAT IS IT?

- What is an object? And a class?
  - Very easy to misunderstand
- Three core principles
  - Encapsulation (information hiding)
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields; and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.

---

## WHAT IS IT?

- The real problem is the definition of objects
  - Messages (methods) and not data
  - Through the three principles, we can regain the correct definition of objects and classes
- Based on extrinsic behaviour
  - Naive objects hierachies are evil

> [..] it is not even about classes. I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is "messaging" [..]
> 
> **â€” Alan Kay**

## PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING

- Building block is represented by the procedure
  - Can have side effects
- Data is primitive or structured in records
- No connection between data and procedures

```c
struct Rectangle { 
    double height, width; 
}; 
double area(Rectangle r) {
    // Code that computes the area of a rectangle 
}
void scale(Rectangle r, double factor) {
    // Code that changes the rectangle r directly
}
```

---

## PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING

- Procedures need the struct as input
  - Very verbose, hard to maintain, a lot of parameters
- Lack of information hiding
  - No restriction, no authorization process
  - Testing is a hell

```c
// From
List<Double> scale(double height, double width, double factor)

// To
Rectangle r = new Rectangle(2.0, 4.0);
r.height = 6.0
printf(area(r)); // we expect 8.0, but a 24.0 is returned
```

---

## OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

- Binding data with behaviours
  - The internal state is hidden from the outside

> The aim of Object-oriented programming is not modeling reality using abstract representations of its component, accidentally called "objects". OOP aims to organize behaviors and data together in structures, minimizing dependencies among them.

```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
    Shape scale(double factor);
} 
class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double height;
    private double width;
}
```

---

## INFORMATION HIDING

**How to build a type using information hiding?**

1. Find procedures sharing the same inputs
2. Get the minimum set of common inputs
   - Avoid tightly coupling
3. Create a structure using those inputs
   - Nope! Data is accessible from everywhere :(
4. Bind the structure with procedures, forming a type
   - Clients must depend only on behaviour
   - Hide data behind a private scope
5. Use interfaces to hide implementations

---

## INFORMATION HIDING

Let's look at an example...

---

## INHERITANCE

> Inheritance is a language feature that allows new objects to be defined from existing ones.

- **Class** (implementation)
  - Internal state and method implementation
- **Type**
  - The set of requests to which it can respond
- **Class inheritance** (code reuse)
  - Reuse of object's implementation
- **Interface inheritance** (subtyping)
  - Reuse of object's behaviour

---

## INHERITANCE

```scala
// Bad code reuse example:
class AlgorithmThatReadFromCsvAndWriteOnMongo(
    filePath: String, mongoUri: String) {
    def read(): List[String] = { /* ... */ }
    def write(lines: List[String]): Unit = { /* ... */ }
}
class AlgorithmThatReadFromKafkaAndWriteOnMongo(
    broker: String, topic: String, mongoUri: String)
  extends AlgorithmThatReadFromCsvAndWriteOnMongo(null, mongoUri) {
    def read(): List[String] = { /* ... */ }
}
class AlgorithmThatReadFromKafkaAndWriteOnMongoAndLogs(
    brk: String, topic: String, mongoUri: String, logFile: String)
  extends AlgorithmThatReadFromKafkaAndWriteOnMongo(
    broker, topic, mongoUri) {
    def write(lines: List[String]): Unit = { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

## INHERITANCE

**The banana, monkey, jungle problem**

- Using a class adds a strong dependency also to parent classes
  - Tight coupling
- One class, one responsibility
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Inheritance only from abstract types

> "The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle."
> 
> **â€” Joe Armstrong**

---

## INHERITANCE AND ENCAPSULATION

**Does class Inheritance break encapsulation?**

- Classes expose two different interfaces
  - Subclasses can access internal state of base classes
  - Public and protected
- More and more clients for a class!!!
  - Increasing of the dependency degree of a class
  - The higher the dependency, the higher the coupling
- **So, try to avoid class inheritance**

---

## SUBTYPING

> Class inheritance defines an object's implementation in terms of another object's implementation. In short, it's a mechanism for code and representation sharing. In contrast, interface inheritance (or subtyping) describes when an object can be used in place of another.

- Inherit only from interfaces and abstract classes
  - Do not override methods
  - Do not hide operation of a parent class
- Loose coupling
  - Clients remain unaware of the specific type
  - Polymorphism depends on subtyping

---

## COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE

- Assembling functionalities into new features
- No internal details

```scala
trait Reader {
    def read(): List[String]
}
trait Writer {
    def write(lines: List[String]): Unit
}
class CsvReader(filePath: String) extends Reader { /* ... */ }
class MongoWriter(mongoUri: String) extends Writer { /* ... */ }
class Migrator(reader: Reader, writers: List[Writer]) {
    val lines = reader.read()
    writers.foreach(_.write(lines))
}
```

---

## WHEN TO USE CLASS INHERITANCE

> **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

- Do not override pre- and post-condition of base class
  - Preconditions must be weaker, post conditions must be stronger than in the base class.
- Design by contract
  - Avoid redefinition of extrinsic public behaviour

---

## CONCLUSIONS

- Define classes in terms of messages
- Never depend upon internal state
- Do not use class inheritance
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Design by contract
- ...
- Using inheritance and information hiding we built a procedure to define types in OOP
